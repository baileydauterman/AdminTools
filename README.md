# AdminTools

A collection of PowerShell Modules that I have created during my time as a System Administrator.

After cloning these repo, run `Import-Module AdminTools.psm1` to load the functions into memory.
Alternatively you can load these on startup by adding:
`Add-Content -Path $profile -Value 'Import-Module "\path\to\folder\AdminTools.psm1"'`
